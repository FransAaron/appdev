### One Piece

>Once upon a time in the Caribbean lived a pirate named Blackbeard…
He was on a journey to find the legendary treasure One Piece. It is said that whoever finds this treasure will become the King of Pirates. One day on a small island…

“Captain, Captain! I’ve found it! The map to One Piece!”
“What?” said Blackbeard. “Oh my, where did you find this?”
“One of the pirates outside dropped it!” Blackbeard was frozen with excitement but finally he shouted, “Men, We’re going to find One Piece!”
“YEAH” shouted the pirates.
